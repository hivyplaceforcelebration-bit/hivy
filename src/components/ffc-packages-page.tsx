            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-amber-900 mt-6">Why Private Venue Celebrations Are Trending in Surat</h3>
            <p>
              The way Surat celebrates special moments has evolved dramatically. Couples and families increasingly prefer private venue celebrations over traditional restaurant gatherings for deeply personal reasons. At HIVY, we've witnessed this shift firsthand, with hundreds of celebrations happening in our exclusive private spaces every month. Privacy allows genuine emotional expressions without the discomfort of public attention, whether it's a heartfelt proposal, an intimate anniversary dinner, or a surprise birthday reveal. The trend reflects a growing desire for meaningful experiences over generic celebrations, where every decoration, every song, and every moment is curated specifically for you.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-amber-900 mt-8">What Distinguishes Each HIVY Package Aesthetically</h3>
            <p>
              Each of our five celebration packages offers a distinct visual identity and atmosphere. The Tent of Romance creates an intimate cocoon with draped fabrics, twinkling fairy lights, and lush decorations that envelope couples in luxury. Fairy Tale Proposals transports you into a storybook setting with grand archways, cascading flowers, and dramatic lighting perfect for life's biggest questions. BoHo Chic brings contemporary warmth with macramé accents, earthy textures, and bohemian elegance that photographs beautifully. Swing of LOVE features our signature decorated swing setup surrounded by romantic elements, creating playful yet intimate vibes. The Elite Group Setup offers sophisticated arrangements that accommodate small gatherings while maintaining HIVY's signature romantic touch.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-amber-900 mt-8">How HIVY Packages Compare to Traditional Restaurants</h3>
            <p>
              Restaurant celebrations come with inherent limitations: crowded environments, time restrictions, standard decorations, and constant interruptions from staff and other guests. HIVY packages transform this experience entirely. You receive three hours of completely private venue access with no strangers walking past your table, no rushed service to accommodate the next reservation, and no generic "Happy Anniversary" sign that's been used a hundred times before. Every decoration is freshly set up for your celebration, every playlist is curated to your preferences, and our team focuses exclusively on making your experience perfect.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-amber-900 mt-8">The Booking to Celebration Journey</h3>
            <p>
              Booking a HIVY package is designed to be seamless. You start by browsing our five packages online or through WhatsApp, selecting the aesthetic that resonates with your occasion. Once you choose a package and date, our team confirms availability and discusses any customizations you desire. We collect necessary details including dietary preferences, personalization requests, and timing preferences. On celebration day, our team sets up your entire experience before your arrival, from decorations to dining arrangements. You simply walk in with your partner or guests and step into a fully prepared celebration space. The three-hour session includes a mojito welcome drink, romantic ambiance, your selected dining experience, celebration cake, unlimited cold drinks, and background music throughout.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-amber-900 mt-8">Understanding Your 3-Hour Exclusive Access</h3>
            <p>
              The three hours included in every package provide ample time for a complete celebration experience. Typically, the first thirty minutes involve arriving, taking photos with the setup, and settling in with your mojito welcome drink. The next ninety minutes cover your dining experience: appetizers, main courses, and conversations without any rush. The remaining hour is perfect for cake cutting, more photos, music enjoyment, and simply being present with each other in a beautiful setting. Many couples tell us this uninterrupted quality time is worth more than any material gift.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-amber-900 mt-8">The HIVY Dining Experience Explained</h3>
            <p>
              Food at HIVY isn't an afterthought—it's integral to your celebration. Each package includes a full dinner menu starting with a refreshing mojito welcome drink, followed by cheese fondue, paneer tortilla, peri peri fries with mac & cheese, tangy loaf, unlimited cold drinks, and ending with a dessert with chocolate bite alongside your celebration cake. Mineral water is also included. We accommodate vegetarian preferences, spice tolerances, and dietary restrictions with advance notice. The dining experience is served at your comfort pace, not rushed or delayed, allowing conversations and celebration to flow naturally around your meal.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-amber-900 mt-8">Customization Possibilities for Every Package</h3>
            <p>
              While each package comes with beautiful standard inclusions, the real magic happens through customization. You can add extra balloon arrangements, rose petal pathways, personalized banners with names and messages, photo frames featuring your relationship memories, LED letter lights spelling meaningful words, and color theme adjustments to match preferences. Birthday celebrations get birthday-specific decorations, anniversaries receive romantic touches, and proposals get the dramatic reveal elements that make the moment perfect. Our team welcomes creative requests and works to incorporate personal touches that make celebrations uniquely yours.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-amber-900 mt-8">Choosing the Right Package: Expert Tips</h3>
            <p>
              Start by considering your primary celebration goal. Proposals lean toward Tent of Romance or Fairy Tale for maximum romantic impact. Anniversaries work beautifully across all packages but particularly shine in BoHo Chic's warm ambiance or Tent of Romance's intimate setting. Birthdays often gravitate toward Swing of LOVE for its playful energy or Fairy Tale for whimsical touches. Group celebrations suit Elite Group Setup's accommodating layout. Budget also guides decisions, with Swing of LOVE offering excellent value at ₹5,100 while Tent of Romance delivers premium luxury at ₹6,500. We're always available on WhatsApp to share photos and videos of each setup to help you visualize the perfect choice.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-amber-900 mt-8">Occasions Each Package Suits Best</h3>
            <p>
              Tent of Romance excels at proposals, honeymoon celebrations, significant anniversaries, and milestone birthdays where maximum romance is desired. Fairy Tale Proposals is designed specifically for engagement moments but also works wonderfully for first anniversaries and romantic birthdays. BoHo Chic attracts couples who appreciate contemporary aesthetics, making it perfect for Instagram-savvy celebrations, casual anniversaries, and artistic personalities. Swing of LOVE brings energetic romance suitable for younger couples, playful celebrations, and those who want unique photo opportunities. Elite Group Setup broadens possibilities to include engagement announcements, double dates, small birthday parties with close friends, and any celebration where sharing joy with a few loved ones enhances the experience.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-amber-900 mt-8">Why HIVY Packages Are Worth the Investment</h3>
            <p>
              When you calculate the cost of replicating a HIVY experience independently—private venue rental, professional decoration, flower arrangements, candles, dining catering, cake, music setup, and coordination efforts—our packages represent remarkable value. Beyond the tangible elements, you're investing in stress-free celebration. There's no running around Surat collecting decorations, no coordinating multiple vendors, no worrying whether everything will come together. You book, you arrive, you celebrate. The memories created in these three hours often become relationship milestones that couples reference for years. For proposals, the "yes" happens in a setting designed to maximize that magical moment. For anniversaries, you reconnect in an atmosphere that honors your journey together. HIVY packages don't just provide a service—they create lasting memories.
