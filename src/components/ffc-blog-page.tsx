                Your Complete Guide to Romantic Celebrations in Surat — Tips, Ideas & Inspiration
              </h2>
              <p>
                Planning a celebration for someone you love is one of life's most exciting challenges. Whether you're searching for <strong>candlelight dinner ideas in Surat</strong>, hunting for the perfect <strong>birthday surprise for your boyfriend or girlfriend</strong>, brainstorming <strong>anniversary celebration plans</strong>, or gathering courage for a <strong>romantic proposal</strong>, the HIVY blog is designed to be your go-to resource. Every article is written by our celebration team — the same people who have orchestrated over 500 magical evenings at Surat's most trusted private celebration venue.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes our blog different from generic lifestyle websites? <strong>Real experience.</strong> Every tip you read here has been tested in our venue. Every idea has been executed for real Surat couples. When we recommend a particular balloon colour combination for a birthday surprise, it's because we've seen how it looks under fairy lights in our tents. When we suggest timing your proposal during the dessert course, it's because we've watched dozens of successful proposals unfold that way — and we know exactly why it works.

                Why We Write — Helping Surat Couples Celebrate Better
              </h3>
              <p>
                Not every couple can visit HIVY for every occasion, and we understand that. Sometimes you just need a good idea — something to spark your creativity so you can surprise your partner at home, in a park, or at a completely different venue. Our blog exists to serve that need too. We share our knowledge freely because we believe that when celebrations anywhere in Surat become more thoughtful, the entire city's romance culture improves.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, if you read an idea you love and realise it would look spectacular inside one of our fairy-lit tents with a professional photographer capturing every moment, we're always just a <a href={`tel:${siteConfig.phone}`} className="text-amber-800 font-bold hover:underline">phone call</a> or <a href={`https://wa.me/${siteConfig.whatsapp}`} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-green-600 font-bold hover:underline">WhatsApp message</a> away. Many of our most memorable celebrations started as a blog article that a partner read at midnight and decided, "This is exactly what I want to do."

                Trending Celebration Ideas in Surat Right Now
              </h3>
              <p>
                Based on our recent bookings and the questions couples ask most frequently, here are the celebration trends dominating Surat in 2025:
              </p>
              <ol className="space-y-2 my-4 list-decimal list-inside">
                <li><strong>Blindfold Surprise Entries</strong> — Partners are led blindfolded to a fully decorated setup, and the "big reveal" moment is captured on video. It's become the most-shared content on Instagram reels from HIVY.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalised Neon Signs</strong> — Custom LED neon messages ("Will You Marry Me?", "Happy 10th Anniversary", or even inside jokes) add a modern, Instagram-worthy element to traditional candlelight setups.</li>
                <li><strong>Midnight Celebrations</strong> — Booking a late-night slot (9 PM–12 AM) so the clock strikes midnight during the celebration is hugely popular for birthdays and anniversaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Balloon Pop Reveals</strong> — Gender reveals, proposal announcements, and surprise messages hidden inside oversized balloons — the pop creates a dramatic moment that guests remember forever.</li>
                <li><strong>Couple Photoshoot Add-ons</strong> — Instead of just a celebration, couples are adding 30-minute professional photoshoots to their packages, using HIVY's decorated setups as stunning backdrops.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Dive into our articles below for detailed guides on each of these trends and many more. Every piece is crafted to give you actionable ideas you can implement immediately — whether at HIVY or anywhere else in Surat.
